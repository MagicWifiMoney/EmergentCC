# Authentication System Test Report

## Summary
The authentication system has been partially fixed but still has a critical issue with the Google OAuth redirect URI. While the frontend correctly uses the `/api` prefix for authentication routes, there's a mismatch in the backend configuration.

## Test Results

### Backend API Testing ✅
- API root endpoint (`/api`) returns 200 OK with correct message
- Google login redirect endpoint (`/api/login/google`) correctly redirects to Google's OAuth consent screen
- Protected endpoints correctly return 401 Unauthorized when accessed without authentication

### Frontend Testing ✅
- Login page loads correctly with glassmorphism design
- "Continue with Google" button is present and clickable
- Clicking the button redirects to Google's OAuth consent screen

## Issues Found ❌

### Critical: Google OAuth Redirect URI Mismatch
- **Error Message**: `redirect_uri_mismatch` from Google OAuth
- **Current Redirect URI**: `https://b24cc02b-55f7-4d08-a4fd-c74e2c6f2cd5.preview.emergentagent.com/auth/google`
- **Expected Redirect URI**: Should include the `/api` prefix to match the route defined in the auth_router

### Root Cause Analysis
1. In `server.py` line 420, the redirect URI is set to:
   ```python
   redirect_uri = f"{FRONTEND_URL}/auth/google"
   ```

2. This should be updated to include the `/api` prefix:
   ```python
   redirect_uri = f"{FRONTEND_URL}/api/auth/google"
   ```

3. The OAuth configuration in line 65 correctly uses:
   ```python
   authorize_redirect_uri=f"{FRONTEND_URL}/api/auth/google"
   ```

4. The frontend correctly uses:
   ```javascript
   window.location.href = `${API_BASE_URL}/api/login/google`;
   ```

## Recommended Fix
Update line 420 in `server.py` to include the `/api` prefix:
```python
redirect_uri = f"{FRONTEND_URL}/api/auth/google"
```

## Conclusion
The authentication system is almost working correctly. The frontend is correctly using the `/api` prefix for all authentication routes, but there's a mismatch in the backend configuration for the Google OAuth redirect URI. Once this is fixed, the Google OAuth flow should work correctly.
